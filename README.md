# Feed Reader Testing Project

## Running the Project

You have two options for viewing and testing the feed reader site:

1. You can [visit the deployed site on GitHub Pages.](https://tobiasziegler.github.io/fend-p8-feed-reader-testing/)

1. For testing and development on a local server:

	1. Clone or download the `master` branch.

	1. Run a local web server, e.g., [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) installed via `npm` or Python's `SimpleHTTPServer`, in the project
	directory. You can then load the site by visiting the appropriate hostname
	(usually `localhost` works fine) and port number with your browser.
